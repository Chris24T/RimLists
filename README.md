# RimLists
A simple script to create a RimWorld modlist from a steam workshop collection url.
The modlist is intended for use with RimPy Mod Manager For Rimworld.

# Usage

1) Download all desired mods from the collection on steam.

2) Run the script, terminal window will open, follow prompts.

3) Modlist will be created at chosen path (default RimPy modlist folder) with chosen name (default collection title)

For now:
- Only includes base game, no DLCs in modlist (you can just add them back manually after modlist creation)
- Does not includes any non-steam mods (again, you can just manually add them after modlist creation)

## Requirements
- Steam is installed
- RimWorld is installed via Steam
- All mods you want in the list must be downloaded - required since i cant find a way to get the mod package ids from the mod Steam ids
